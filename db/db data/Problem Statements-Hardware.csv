NH-H22,Developing writing pen and writing pad for children with Specific learning disability.,"Children with Specific Learning Disability (SLD)who faces challenge of writing during their academic life especially during examinations where they need the provisions of a scribe. The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this. Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example: 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam. Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks. Expected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.",Smart Education
NH-H23,"Al based acoustic wave monitoring of rail defects like cracks, fracture and prediction for rail wear, quality along with other parameter.","Rails are used for the movement of trains and if there are major defects in the track then accident may happen or riding comfort in train may be compromised. Rail defects such as cracks, fractures, and wear are critical issues in the railway industry, leading to safety hazards, operational disruptions, and increased maintenance costs. Early detection and prediction of these defects are essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of railway infrastructure. These defects are to be noticed while train is moving. Description: The problem statement aims to develop an Al-based acoustic wave monitoring system for the early detection of rail defects and prediction of wear and quality parameters. The system will utilize acoustic waves to transmit to the rail tracks and its pattern will be monitored. The system will be capable of distinguishing between normal operating conditions and the presence of defects or abnormal wear patterns. Expected Solution: The proposed solution will involve the development of a comprehensive acoustic wave monitoring system for railway tracks. This system will consist of transmission side and reception side. Reception side sensors would be capable of predicting the track structure, quality of the rail and distance from a central fixed point.",Smart Automation
NH-H24,"Development of Tyre Maintenance and Operation App, including fitment of necessary IIoT related hardware in Dumpers","Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each. Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important. TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation. TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour) Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift. Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory. More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must. Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition. Tyre Pressure Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources. Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Tyre Performance Analysis Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres. Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.",Smart Automation
